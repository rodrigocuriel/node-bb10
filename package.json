This ID must be unique, not only within your app but\n    in the entire world! Most of the time, people make a combination of their packagename and a timestamp. An example\n    of an ID could be\n\n    `eu.endare.appName@1374148800`\n    </dd>\n\n  <dt>applicationID and password</dt>\n  <dd>When you register your application with BlackBerry, they will send you an email with these credentials. Just copy-paste them in here and you should be good to go!</dd>\n  \n  <dt>CPID</dt>\n  <dd>CPID stands for Content Provider ID and is provided by BlackBerry as well. Just look into the email you received and copy-paste this ID.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n## Development\n\nIf you are testing your application, BlackBerry works with an evaluation URL. If you want to run in evaluation/development mode you should add an extra parameter\nwhen creating the pushinitiator.\n\n```js\nvar initiator = new bb10.PushInitiator(applicationId, password, CPID, true);\n```\n\n## Contributors\n * [SamVerschueren]     <verschueren.sam@endare.eu>\n\n## Changelog\n**1.0.0:**\n * first release\n \n## The full MIT license\n\nThe MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Endare BVBA <info@endare.eu>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
